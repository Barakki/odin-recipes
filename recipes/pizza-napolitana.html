        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Making the dough</li></h3>
            <p>To make the dough, mix the flour with the salt in a bowl.</p>
            <p>In another container, mix the yeast in the water until fully dissolved. Add 3 tbsp. of olive oil.</P>
            <p>Next, add the liquids in the bowl with the flour and start mixing with a fork or by hand. As it becomes a ball, you can throw it in the counter and start kneading it.</p>
            <p>After kneading it for about 5 to 10 minutes. you should have a homogeneous ball of dough. Now drizzle some olive oil in a bowl (it can be the same bowl you started with) and put in the dough. Let it rest until double the size or for about an hour.</p>
            <h3><li>Shaping the dough</li></h3>
            <p>Once the dough has risen, degas the dough and divide it in 2 (or 4 if you like thin crust) and reshape them into balls.</p>
            <p>Let them rise for at least half an hour.</p>
            <p>Now we'll go to the actual shaping. Start by sprinkling flour on your work surface and on the dough, then, gently start pressing the dough into a disc, you can use a rolling pin if you want. If you notice the dough stops stretching to your liking, you can let it rest for 5 minutes and then keep going.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle some flour on your pizza sheet and then place the dough. Let rest for 5 to 15 minutes. Now would be a good time to preheat your oven to 180-200Â°C if you haven't already.</p>
            <h3><li>Actual cooking</li></h3>
            <p>Before putting the pizza in the oven, stab the dough with a fork several time to avoid big bubbles.</p>
            <p>Now, add a layer of sauce to the pizza and put it in the oven for 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>While the pizza is in the oven, it is a good time to shred the cheese, slice the tomato in thin slices and mince the garlic.</p>
            <p>After 10 minutes, take the pizza out of the oven, add a more sauce to your liking, add the cheese, then the tomato and sprinkle the minced garlic on top.</p>
            <p>Get the pizza back in the oven for 5 to 10 more minutes or until the bottom is golden brown.</p>
            <p>After getting the pizza out of the oven, you can sprinkle some oregano and add some olives, but let the pizza rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing.</p>
            <h3><li>Enjoy!</li></h3>
